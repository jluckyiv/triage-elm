# Development notes
## Branch yak-shaving
After getting the basic app up and running, I followed directions from [Elm Tutorial](https://www.elm-tutorial.org/en/) on [setting up a fake backend](https://www.elm-tutorial.org/en/04-starting/02-backend.html) with [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server). The tutorial pinned v0.9.5, but I used the latest, which is 0.14.0. For some reason, I can't get the root screen of json-server to show anymore, whether or not I use the old version.
